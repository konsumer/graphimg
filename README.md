# graphimg

Make graphs from many graph formats

## supported formats

* dot from [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)


## why?

There are quite a few libraries that parse all these graph DSLs, but many of them require a browser (real or virtual) to work. I wanted a pure JS library to parse and output each of them.
